**NOTE:** many of my mistakes was due to the fact that I wasn't considering the
fact an array is not copied when assigned to another variable. This is a
problem because I was modifying the original array when I was assigning it to
another variable. This is why I was getting weird results.

Remember to use literal copy of arrays when needed.
