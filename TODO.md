**NOTE:** many of my mistakes was due to the fact that I wasn't considering the
fact an array is not copied when assigned to another variable. This is a
problem because I was modifying the original array when I was assigning it to
another variable. This is why I was getting weird results.

Remember to use literal copy of arrays when needed.

# data_calculator.py

[] implement `calculate_distance_matrix` function using `scipy.spatial.distance_matrix`
[] implement `calculate_distance_matrix` function using `pandas.DataFrame`
[] implement `calculate_distance_matrix` function using `networkx.Graph`
[] store the distance matrix in a meory and use it instead of recalculating distances every time

# local_search.py

[] implement Linâ€“Kernighan heuristic
[] implement 3-opt with a stopping criterion

# visualization.py

[] unit tests for print_chromosome

# crossover.py

[] fix the buggy `cycle_crossover` function

# potential useful libraries
